The image planner considers optimal trajectories in a short term horizon within in the image space, removing the need of local cost map generation.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 
- [ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) 
- [Gazebo](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros) 

## Installing 
Within the `src` directory of a ROS2 workspace (e.g. `/colcon_ws`):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SuryaKannan/image_path_planning.git --recurse-submodules
cd .. && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
echo "export LINOROBOT2_BASE=4wd" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Quick Start
### 1) Launch Linorobot2 Gazebo environment
```shell
ros2 launch linorobot2_gazebo gazebo.launch.py
```


### 2) Launch Image Planner
```shell
ros2 launch image_planner image_planner.launch.py rviz:=true
```

### 3) Select a Goal Pose using RVIZ

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue  | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Gazebo simulation isn't launching  | Remove the build, log and install files and re-run colcon build WITHOUT the --symlink-install flag. If you are connected to a LAN with other computers running ROS2, make sure you have a different ROS_DOMAIN_ID. The last thing to try is to use ```$ killall gzserver``` in the event there are background processes still running that haven't exited cleanly|
| RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in double_scalars m = (point2[1]-point1[1])/(np.cosh(point2[0])-np.cosh(point1[0]))  | Ensure the [number of trajectories chosen](/waypoint_generator/waypoint_generator/waypoint_publisher_node.py) is even. If still this warning appears with no visualisable waypoints in RVIZ, re-run the launch file |
| No Waypoints spawn and no image appears  | Relaunch the image planner launch file. You may need to do this several times. Try to disable Visualisation to help |
